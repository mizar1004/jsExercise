			That happened at around 12pm, in <em class="word"><script>document.write(space);</script></em>.<br />	
			I went out to buy some snack, and bought <em class="word"><script>document.write(food);</script></em>.<br />
			On the way back to the <em class="word"><script class="word">document.write(space);</script></em>, <br />
			I heard cat's crying. KKo-Maeng-E was there.<br />
			I patted on his head and then, <br />
			KKo-Maeng-E suddenly turned into a big..big...<em class="word"><script class="word">document.write(animal);</script></em>! <br />
			He threatened me to PEE on my shoes if I don't give <em class="word"><script class="word">document.write(food);</script></em> to him. <br />
			Never got threatened, but with some pity, I threw all I got to him. <br />
			He started to eat it using his whity hands.<br />
		</p>
		<p>	
			Ding, Dang, Dong...<br />
		</p>
		<p>	
			When the bell went for 12 o'clock out in the distance,<br />
			A <em class="word"><script class="word">document.write(vehicle);</script></em> came and stopped next to us.<br />
			He finished eating and got on v<script class="word">document.write(vehicle);</script></em>,<br />
			...leaving words like,<br />
			"Generous <em class="word"><script class="word">document.write(userName);</script></em>,"<br />
			"You showed me your kindness so that I will let you know my secret."<br />
			He left a piece of paper, giving me a pitiful look.<br />
			the sentence on the paper was...<br />
			"My salary is <em class="word"><script class="word">document.write(salary);</script></em>" <br />
